# JShell

JShell is a simple command-line shell implementation in Java. It supports various basic shell commands like `cd`, `ls`, `echo`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `cp`, and `mv`. The shell provides an interactive environment for file system manipulation and command execution. It is designed to demonstrate how basic Unix-like shell operations can be implemented using Java.
